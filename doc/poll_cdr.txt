DATA COLLECTION SCRIPT (poll_cdr.sh)


Description

poll_cdr.sh does following steps:
- retreives CDR from each NE;
- checks CDR file integrity and consistency;
- copies checked file to archive directory and DIH input directory


Periodicity

Every 20 min - 20th, 40th and 00th minute of each hour


Files and directories

<work> is BSCS working directory usually defined by $WORK_DIR
variable.

Control log file

When script begins operations, the following control file is
created:

<work>/CTRL/poll_cdr.PID
This file contains PID number of the process started by the
script.

Error log file

All the actions during the sript operation are written to log-file.
Log file is named using the following name conventions:

<work>/TMP/POLL_CDR_yyyymmddhh24mi.LOG

All general error messages and actions are written into this file.


Workflow

Configuration variables

All the NE to get the data from are stored in msc_list.txt file.
This file should be must be placed in <work> directory.

File format:

MSC_NAME - MSC's name
IP_ADDRESS - IP address or host name of MSC to connect to
FTP_USER - username to be used in FTP session
FTP_PASS - password to be used in FTP session
FILE_DIR - directory name under WORK_DIR to put files in
FILE_PREFIX - file prefix to be used for new files
REMOTE_FILENAME - filename on NE to get
TMP_FILENAME - temporary filename to put files during download
process

All the variables should be put on one line. Delimiter -
whitespace.

Data collection

Data is retreived from all the NE in the list using FTP protocol.
Used protocol is not the standard one and contains only restricted
set of commands due to security and consistency reasons.

Script connects to NE by FTP using FTP_USER and FTP_PASS supplied.
In case of any FTP errors the file is not released on MSC and the
same file will be downloaded on the next session.

Integrity checking

Each file from MSC is retreived in 2 copies. After the copies are
compared and found identical, one of them is renamed accordingly to
FILE_PREFIX and put into WORK_DIR/FILE_DIR directory.
Name of the last file retreived is written to ID file that must exist
in each directory.
ID filename mask:
YYMMDDHH24MI.ID

ID file contents:
INDEX file. DO NOT DELETE!
Last cdr file downloaded: - IA.ICMCRAL.0412051100

If either ID file or CDR file mentioned in ID file
doesn't exist, process skips current NE and tries to process next
one.

After the file is copied from NE and passed all the necessary
checks, it is copied into ARCHIVE_DIR/FILE_DIR and to DIH_INPUT_DIR
directory for DIH processing.

In case of any errors during execution, script skips processing for
this NE and tries to process next one.

After all the NE from MSC list are processed, log file is sent to
SUPPORT_MAIL address.

Possible problems.

1. File backup for ${MSC_NAME} failed.
Copying of the retreived file to archive directory failed.
Actions: check the reason for the error and copy the file to
archive directory.
2. Release of CDR file on "${MSC_NAME}" has failed. 
File was not released on NE after downloading.
Actions: wait for the next download session. If the problem persists,
inform Network Operations Group (noc@wataniya-algerie.com)
3. FTP transfer for "${MSC_NAME}" failed
An error occured during FTP session
Actions: wait for the next download session. If the problem persist,
check possible reasons for failure. Inform NOC if needed
4. CDR file integrity check for "${MSC_NAME}" failed
There was an error during FTP download. File was not downloaded
completely or is damaged.
Actions: see p.3
5. Download from "${MSC_NAME}" failed
There was an error during FTP download.
Actions: see p.3
6. ID file is not found
ID file in corresponding directory is missing.
Actions: recreate the file according to the rules specified.
7. CDR file specified in ID file doesn't exist
CDR file specified in ID file is non-existing or incorrect.
Actions: if the file specified in ID file was moved to archive,
restore the file. If it doesn't exist - create a dummy file or
modify ID file to point to existing one.
8. More than one ID file exists
There are more than one ID file in correspoding directory.
Actions: delete one of the ID files.
9. Process is already running. Exiting...
Previuos download session is still running.
Actions: check if session is OK. If it's finished - delete the
control file from CTRL directory.
10. MSC "${MSC_NAME}" is not available
MSC cannot be accessed
Actions: wait for the next download session. If the problem
persists, manual check is needed. If MSC is not available, inform
NOC.
