All the CDR files retreived from MSC and SCSN are placed into
subdirectories under WORK_DIR directory. Now it's configured
as /bscs/work/MP/SWITCH/FTAM/IN

All the datasources (NE) are stored in
/bscs/work/MP/SWITCH/FTAM/IN/msc_list.txt file.
File format:
MSC_NAME - name of the NE
IP_ADDRESS - IP address. Could (and should) be changed to DNS name
FTP_USER - FTP username to be used for NE connection
FTP_PASS - FTP password to use in connection
FILE_DIR - subdirectory name to put files in (in working and archival
directories)
FILE_PREFIX - prefix for files to be created with
REMOTE_FILE - filename on the NE to get while FTP session
After the file is retreived and checked, it is copied into
/bscs/work/ARCHIVE/CDR
directory into the same subdirectories.
These files are archived every night by archive_cdr.sh script.

Workflow:
- directory list is retreived from MSC_LIST file under WORK_DIR
directory
- for each FILE_DIR from list under ARCHIVE_DIR directory all the
files by mask FILE_PREFIX.YESTERDAY are tarred and gzipped
- if previous step is successful, all the files by the same mask
are deleted from ARCHIVE_DIR and WORK_DIR

Retention period to store data in the archive directory is one month.
After that all the files must be moved onto the tapes and deleted
from archive directory.
